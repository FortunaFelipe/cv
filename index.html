        <p><em>Doctoral Student at <strong>ISEP - Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto</strong> </em></p>
        <P>I am a Doctoral Student in Production Engineering at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), specializing
            in multicriteria decision aid (MCDA). Recently, I had the opportunity to present my work at the Global
            Finance Conference, where I showcased a paper on applying decision support methods in portfolio
            construction. In addition, I have multiple publications in national and international conferences and
            journals, highlighting my contributions and advancements in the finance field.
           <br><br>In my professional experience, I was partner at All Investimentos, working as a Sales & Trader on the
            equities desk. In this role, I developed solid experience in commercial and operational support, focusing on
            stock trading and financial advisory. My responsibilities included developing investment strategies,
            executing trading operations, and maintaining close, trustworthy relationships with our clients, always
            aiming to meet their financial needs and goals.</P>
